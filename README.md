This is a word-guessing game build in python.

Once the program is started, a word will be randomly selected from a bank, and the player can guess individual letters, or the whole word.
Players are able to guess individual letters, but they only get threefull word guesses.
Each time a letter is guessed, the player's score increases by 1; lower scores are better in this game. 

After the game is over, the player is prompted to enter their name so that the program can plot their score on a graph. 

This program should be run in the Anaconda Prompt window, or Mac Terminal. 

Other contributors to this program include:
-YouTube tutorials on how to use Git
-matplotlib.org information on how to use Python to plot data
-INST126 lecture slides and example code from course modules
-Pair Programming sessions with classmates (Kelly Kim, Leanna Seck)
